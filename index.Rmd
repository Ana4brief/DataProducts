## Ultimatum game

- first player proposes how to split a given amount between himself and the second player

- second player accepts and the amount is split as proposed, or rejects and neither player get anything

--- 

## Strategy of proposer

- learn the minimum amount the second player would consider a fair split and accept

---

## Present version

- second player is the computer

- repeated one-shot (no accumulated earnings)

---

## Probability of split being accepted

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Nrep<-10000
self<-floor(runif(Nrep,min=0,max=10))
away<-10-self
decision<-NULL
for(i in seq_along(1:Nrep)){
  decision[i]<-((away[i]/self[i])>(0.3+runif(1,min=-0.1,max=0.4)))
}
prob<-NULL
for(i in seq_along(1:10)){
  prob[i]<-mean(decision[self==i])
}
plot(1:10,prob,xlab="Kept for self",ylab="Probability of accepted")
```
